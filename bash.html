            <h2>üî© Bash & Shell Scripting</h2>

            <p class="froggy-intro">"Ribbit-ribbit! Welcome, future Bash master!" chirps Froggy, adjusting his tiny wizard hat. "Did you know Bash is one of the most powerful spells in a DevOps toolkit? It helps us chat with computers, automate yucky chores, and manage servers like a true sorcerer! Ready to learn some amazing magic with me?"</p>

            <h3>üê∏ Froggy's First Spells: What We'll Learn!</h3>
            <p>Froggy has his magic scroll ready! Here are some of the amazing things we'll explore together in the world of Bash:</p>

            <h4>‚ú® Crafting Your First Automation Spells (Scripts!)</h4>
            <p>Imagine you have a task you do every day, like tidying your lily pad. With Bash, we can write a 'script' ‚Äì a list of commands ‚Äì to do it automatically! Froggy says, "It's like teaching your computer a new trick that it can do all by itself!" We'll learn how to create these scripts from scratch. Froggy wonders: What's one repetitive task YOU'D love to automate first? Keep that in mind as we go!</p>

            <h4>üìÇ Managing Your Digital Pond (Files & Processes)</h4>
            <p>"Every good wizard needs to keep their potions and scrolls organized!" Froggy explains. "In Bash, we'll learn how to find files (like searching for that one special firefly), check how much space is left on our digital lily pads (disk usage), and see what tasks (processes) our computer is busy with. Ever wonder what your computer is secretly working on? We'll find out! Super handy!"</p>

            <h4>üóùÔ∏è Unlocking Secret Passages (Environment Variables & Config Files)</h4>
            <p>Froggy leans in conspiratorially, "Computers have secret codes called 'environment variables' that tell scripts how to behave, and 'configuration files' that are like treasure maps for programs. We'll learn how to read and use these to customize our spells and tools! Froggy asks: If your computer had a secret name, what would it be and how would you tell a script?"</p>

            <h4>üìú Writing Reusable Magic Incantations (Shell Functions)</h4>
            <p>"Why say 'abracadabra-alakazam-turn-this-log-green' every time?" asks Froggy, chuckling. "We can create 'functions' ‚Äì reusable sets of commands ‚Äì for common tasks. Write it once, use it anywhere! It‚Äôs like having your own book of powerful, pre-written spells! Froggy's curious: What's a silly, repetitive task you wish you had a magic function for in real life?"</p>

            <h4>üî≠ Keeping an Eye on the Kingdom (Scripting for Continuous Monitoring)</h4>
            <p>With a tiny telescope, Froggy demonstrates, "Good DevOps wizards always keep an eye on their systems. We'll learn to write scripts that can continuously watch over things, like checking if a friendly server frog is still online or if our magical services are running smoothly. If something's amiss, our scripts can even send us an alert! Froggy ponders: If you had a magic monitoring script for your room, what would you want it to alert you about?"</p>

            <div class="froggy-tip reveal-on-scroll">
                <img src="images/froggy.svg" alt="Froggy giving a tip">
                <p><strong>Froggy whispers:</strong> "The best way to become a Bash wizard is to practice, practice, practice! Don't be afraid to try out these commands and write your own little scripts. The more you experiment, the more powerful your spells will become!"</p>
            </div>

            <h3>üß™ Time to Get Our Hands Muddy: Practice Challenges!</h3>
            <p>Froggy believes the best way to learn is by doing! Here are some challenges for you to try:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automate</strong> backup and cleanup tasks on a server using shell scripts.
                    <p><em>Example script for automating backups:</em></p>
<pre data-language="bash"><code>#!/bin/bash
# Simple backup script example
SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
DSTDIR="/mnt/backups/daily"
FILENAME="backup_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).tar.gz"

echo "Starting backup of ${SRCDIR}..."
tar -czf "${DSTDIR}/${FILENAME}" "${SRCDIR}"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Backup successful: ${DSTDIR}/${FILENAME}"
else
  echo "Backup failed!"
fi</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Create</strong> a health check script to monitor system resources (e.g., disk space, CPU usage).</li>
            </ul>
            <hr class="section-divider">
            <h3>üìú Froggy's Scrolls of Wisdom: Further Reading</h3>
            <p>Froggy highly recommends consulting the official GNU Bash manual for the most detailed and authoritative information. Here are some starting points based on what we've discussed:</p>

            <p>Remember, the command line is your friend! You can also often learn about a command by typing <code>man command_name</code> (e.g., <code>man ls</code>) or <code>command_name --help</code>.</p>
